This project helps individuals with impaired vision navigate the streets of a city. The system detects obstacles, recognizes traffic lights and guides the user to his/her desired destination. It's obstacle detector system can detect pedestrians, dogs, pigeons, light poles, the edge of sidewalks, garbage bins, bus shelters, etc. It also has a traffic light detector that is able to identify green, yellow and red lights. Lastly, it has a navigator that tells the user the directions to follow to get to his/her desired destination. These three systems are placed on a medical walker. A 12 volt, 4.5 Ah battery provides power for all subsystems (except for the phone).
